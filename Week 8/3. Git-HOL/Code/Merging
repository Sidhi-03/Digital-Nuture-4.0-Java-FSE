# Step 1: Switch back to the master branch
git checkout master

# Step 2: List out all differences between master and GitNewBranch (in CLI)
git diff master GitNewBranch

# Step 3: (Optional, visual diff) Open P4Merge to see visual difference
# You must configure P4Merge as your diff tool before this
git difftool master GitNewBranch

# Step 4: Merge the source branch (GitNewBranch) into master
git merge GitNewBranch

# Step 5: Observe log after merge using graph view
git log --oneline --graph --decorate

# Step 6: Delete the merged branch
git branch -d GitNewBranch

# Step 7: Confirm current branch and status
git status
