1. What is SPA (Single-Page Application)?
An SPA is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without refreshing the page.
Benefits:
Fast & responsive UI
Smooth user experience
Reduced server load
Better caching & offline support
Ideal for modern web apps like dashboards or social media


2. What is React?
React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building dynamic and reusable UI components. It's commonly used for SPAs.
How React Works:
Uses Virtual DOM for efficient updates.
Only updates parts of the UI that change.
Follows a component-based structure.


3. SPA vs MPA (Multi-Page Application)
| SPA                            | MPA                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Loads a single HTML page       | Loads multiple HTML pages        |
| Faster and smoother UX         | Slower due to full reloads       |
| Uses AJAX/API calls for data   | Each request loads a new page    |
| Better suited for dynamic apps | Better for static content or SEO |


4. Pros & Cons of SPAs
Pros:
Fast, smooth navigation
Less server bandwidth
App-like feel
Cons:
Harder SEO
Initial load can be heavy
Requires JavaScript to work well



5. What is Virtual DOM?
A Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to efficiently update only the parts of the UI that change, improving performance.


6. Key Features of React
Component-based architecture
JSX syntax (HTML + JS)
Virtual DOM for fast rendering
One-way data flow
Hooks for state & lifecycle in functions
React Router for page navigation
Supports both client-side and server-side rendering
